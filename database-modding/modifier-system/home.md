# The Modifier System - About
The Modifier System is the way most effects and abilities in Civilization VI are implemented. While limited in some ways, they can be remarkably powerful and are central to gameplay modding in Civilization VI.

Modifiers are are owned by an object (for instance, a Player, a City, or even the Game Session itself). Modifiers can have [Requirement Sets](/database-modding/modifier-system/requirement-sets) (which themselves are composed of multiple [Requirements](/database-modding/modifier-system/requirements) that determine whether the Modifier's Effect ought to be applied.
